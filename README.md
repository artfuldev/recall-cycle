## Recall
It is a simple app, with a square grid of 25 squares. When a new game starts, 9 cells are selected at random, and shown to the user for a few seconds. Afterwards, the question is hidden, and the user has to select the 9 cells correctly, by clicking on them again. Once the user selects 9 cells, we compare them with our question. If he got all of the 9 cells right, he is awarded a score of 1.
